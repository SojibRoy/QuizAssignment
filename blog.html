           <p class="ans-para">
            The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

              <h4>Strict equality and undefined</h4>
              You can use undefined and the strict equality and inequality operators to determine whether a variable has a value. In the following code, the variable x is not initialized, and the if statement evaluates to true.</li>
              <li>
                <h4>typeof operator and undefined</h4>
                One reason to use typeof is that it does not throw an error if the variable has not been declared.
